# Gogobot EDU SDK

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh_CN.md)

Python SDK for the **Changba AI-Dog / Gogobot EDU** quadruped robot. It provides a simple synchronous API for classroom programming, BLE robot control, action choreography, sensor streaming, and optional Dev PC WebSocket audio/sensor workflows.

## Highlights

- BLE scan, connect, command, and notification handling.
- High-level actions, ears, expressions, tones, and movement control.
- IMU and TOF sensor streaming through BLE `ae04` notifications.
- Dev PC WebSocket host for LAN sensor JSON and bidirectional PCM audio.
- Smooth pose, foot, and joint adjustment APIs for advanced choreography.
- EDU-oriented examples for teachers, students, labs, and course platforms.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- BLE support on the host computer
- `bleak >= 0.21`
- Optional audio/LAN dependencies:
  - `websockets`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

```bash
cd aidog_sdk
pip install -e .
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev_pc_ws]"
pip install -e ".[bidir_audio]"
```

Development tools:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Common checks:

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
mypy aidog_sdk
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

## Quick Start

```python
from aidog_sdk import AiDog, Action, EarAction, ExpressionAction, Tone, Movement

with AiDog() as dog:
    dog.connect("Changba-Ai-Dog", retries=3, retry_delay_s=1.0)

    dog.perform_action(Action.SIT_DOWN)
    dog.perform_action("shake_hand")

    dog.send_movement(Movement.FORWARD, duration_s=2.0)
    dog.stop_movement()

    dog.send_ear(EarAction.EAR_STAND_LEFT)
    dog.send_expression(ExpressionAction.HAPPY_01)
    dog.send_audio(Tone.JEEZ)
    dog.set_volume(3, verify_tone=Tone.BEAT1)
```

More setup details: [Quick Start](docs/quick_start.en.md).

## Logging

The SDK uses Python `logging` for library messages and does not configure
handlers by default. Enable logs in your application when needed:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

Use `logging.DEBUG` when troubleshooting BLE discovery and notification setup.
