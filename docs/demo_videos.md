# Demo Videos

These videos show the SDK demos running on the real robot.

## GitHub Playback

GitHub does not reliably render repository-relative MP4 files from an HTML
`<video>` tag in Markdown. To show an inline player on GitHub:

1. Open an issue, pull request, or discussion comment on GitHub.
2. Drag the `.mp4` file into the comment box and wait for GitHub to upload it.
3. Copy the generated `https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...` URL.
4. Paste that URL on its own line in the "GitHub player URL" slot below.

GitHub upload limits are 10 MB for videos on free user/organization repositories
and 100 MB on paid plans. `demo1.mp4` is currently larger than 10 MB, so compress
it before uploading on a free plan.

## Demo 1: Performance Routine

- Script: [`demo/demo_1_performance.py`](../demo/demo_1_performance.py)
- Local MP4: [`docs/assets/demos/demo1.mp4`](assets/demos/demo1.mp4)
- Shows: ears, expressions, actions, forward movement, angle turning, slow crouch, sleepy expression, stretch, and tail wag.

<!-- Paste the GitHub-uploaded video URL on the next line. It must be a bare URL, not a Markdown link. -->

## Demo 2: Custom Action

- Script: [`demo/demo_2_custom_action.py`](../demo/demo_2_custom_action.py)
- Local MP4: [`docs/assets/demos/demo2.mp4`](assets/demos/demo2.mp4)
- Shows: forward movement followed by a custom sniff-like action built from smooth body/foot adjustment, expression, and audio.

## Notes

- Run the demos in an open area and keep the robot away from table edges or stairs.
- Use a charged battery before recording or demonstrating long action sequences.
- The local MP4 links are still useful for cloning the repository and opening the
  files directly.
