"""Run a custom sniff-like robot-adjustment action.

Purpose:
    Demonstrate a firmware-like sniff motion built from foot adjustments,
    expression, and audio.
Risk level:
    High. This script changes foot targets and requires matching firmware.
Dependencies:
    pip install -e .
Run:
    python demo/demo_2_custom_action.py
Expected result:
    The robot moves forward, performs the sniff-like motion, and returns to basic mode.
Exit:
    Wait for completion, or press Ctrl+C.
