"""Run a staged robot performance routine.

Purpose:
    Demonstrate a complete show sequence with actions, movement, angle turning,
    audio, expressions, ears, and lights.
Risk level:
    Medium. The robot will walk, turn, jump, crouch, and move body/legs.
Dependencies:
    pip install -e .
Run:
    python demo/demo_1_performance.py
Expected result:
    The robot performs the scripted routine and returns to its normal state.
Exit:
    Wait for completion, or press Ctrl+C. The script stops audio/movement in cleanup.
